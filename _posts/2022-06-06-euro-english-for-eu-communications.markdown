The European Union commissioners agreed to adopt English as the preferred 
language for European communications, rather than German, which was the other 
 possibility. They unanimously agreed also that English spelling needs improvement and decided
it to undergo a five-year revision plan to become the new Euro English.

In the first year, "s" will be used instead of the soft "c". 
Sertainly, sivil servants will resieve this news with joy. Also, the hard 
"c" will be replaced with "k". Not only will this klear up konfusion, but 
keyboards kan have one less letter.

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when 
the troublesome "ph" will be replaced by "f". This will make words 
like "fotograf" 20% shorter.

In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted 
to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. 
Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always 
ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible 
mes of silent "e"s in the languag is disgrasful, and be taken away.

By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing 
"th" by "z" and "w" by " v".

During ze fifz year, ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd from vords kontaining "ou", 
and similar shanges vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters.

After ze fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl. Zer vil be no mor 
trubls or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi tu understand ech ozer.

Ze drem vil finali kum tru.
